    "Equation (31b) is the pressure equation we obtained previously, i.e. [Eq. (27)](#eq27). Looking at Eq. (31a) we see that we do not need pressure values left of the boundary, i.e. $p_{i-1,j}$. So why have we previously announced that we use the pressure next to the boundaries? By comparing Eq. (31a) with Eq. (31b) we see that both equations are very similar, except for the second pressure time on the R.H.S. . This term can be forced to zero if we assume a very high density $\\rho_{i-1,j}$ while keeping the pressure $p_{i-1,j}$ finite. In the numerical scheme this is done by setting the density to a high value and setting the pressure at $p_{i-1,j}=0$. Then we don't need to use different equations to solve at the boundaries. Ok, this holds only on the left boundary but similar relations can be obtained, all lead to the conditions, that the wall normal velocity is used together high densities and zero pressure in the ghost cells."
