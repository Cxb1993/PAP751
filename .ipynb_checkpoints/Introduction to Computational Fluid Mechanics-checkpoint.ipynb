    "# Introduction to Computational Fluid Mechanics (CFD) with IPython\n",
    "\n",
    "This course provides an introduction to various techniques used in computational fluid mechanics for incompressible 2-dimensional viscous flow and ideal flow in 2d and axisymmetry. Currently as of **1.12.2015**, the course covers finite difference and finite volume methods to solve the incompresible Navier Stokes equation in 2 dimensions, as well as the boundary element method in 2d and in axisymmetry. Following this course you will become aquainted with the inner workings of these three CFD techniques. We make heavy use of resources from our colleagues, in particular the excellent starter course of [Prof Barba (12 Steps to Navier Stoke)](http://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/), the public chapters from [Prof WT Ang](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/mwtang/bem2011.html) on the boundary element method, and the great tutorial on finite volumes and multiphase flows by [Prof Tryggvason](http://www3.nd.edu/~gtryggva/MultiphaseDNS/index.html). All parts of this course utilize Python, in particular IPython using the Jupyter web interface.\n",
    "The strength of this course is that all the algebra is covered directly with some easy to read code. You can see one-to-one how a formula is coded and the result of the program. IPython allows to show everything on one web page and even lets you modify the program on the go.  \n",

    "## 1. Finite Difference Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The finite difference method is the most accessible method to write partial differential equations in a computerized form. The equations can be solved explictly where the solution for a particular computational node is available through some algebra from the surrounding nodes. Implicit methods in contrast need to solve a large number of equations as many nodes must me solved simultaneously. This is typically done by rewriting the equations as a matrix equation and inverting the matrix. In this course we use mostly explicit techniques. The best way is likely to go one after another. If you have already a background in the numerical technque of finite differences but you want to understand the specific implementation of the Navier Stokes equation you may want to skip the first few steps of chapter 1.1. \n",

    "### 1.1 Twelve steps to Navier-Stokes \n",
    "To get started please [follow](http://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/) the excellent introduction of Prof Barba of **12 steps to Navier-Stokes**.\n",
    "The course ends with a velocity pressure formulation of the Navier-Stokes Equations. She introduces simple grids where the pressure and velocity is defined at the center of the grid. We continue to use this geometry for the rest of the finite difference method below.\n",

    "### 1.2 von Neumann stability analysis \n",
    "Using the diffusion equation as an example the [stability of the numerical method](Finite Difference Techniques/04_Stability analysis of numerical solutions to the diffusion equation.ipynb) is studied analytically with the *von Neumann* method. Both explicit and implict methods are discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Pressure velocity formulation\n",
    "This is repeated from Prof Barba's course, yet with a more solid boundary condition for the [pressure velocity formulation](Finite Difference Techniques/06_velocity pressure formulation.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Pressure Poisson equation\n",
    "Solving the pressure equations is computationaly the most costly part. There are various strategies to solve the Laplace and Poisson equation. A discussion of various techniques and example codes are provided [in this notebook](Finite Difference Techniques/08_Laplace & Poisson Equation - Iterative Methods.ipynb). Please feel free to use the snippets and improve the solver from Chapter 1.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Vorticty streamfunction formulation\n",
    "Besides the velocity pressure formulation we can write the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in 2 dimensions with the [streamfunction and the vorticity](05_vorticity_streamfunction.ipynb). This formulations removes the pressure Poisson equation at the cost of an increase in complexity for the boundary conditions. \n",
