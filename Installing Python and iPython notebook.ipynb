    "Although Python comes standard with OS X and Linux, not all the packages required might come with the OS. The packages we use are `numpy` (mathematical operations), `scipy` (a full scientific package of which `numpy` is a subset), `matplotlib` (graphical plotting) and `jupyter` (for the notebook interface). \n",

    "* On Linux-based systems it is probably best to use the system package manager, `apt-get` on Ubuntu-based systems or `yum` on Red Hat / Fedora based systems. [Installation instructions for `scipy`, `numpy` and `matplotlib` are available here.](http://www.scipy.org/install.html)\n",
    "* Install a second Python distribution like Anaconda or Canopy that will sit side by side with the system's Python. This is probably the best solution for Mac OS users, since the installers are in a graphical user interface. \n",

Although the official Python website has an installer for Windows, we instead recommend installing the free [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) distributions for Python. These packages incorporate the scientific packages required for the course. The installation is in a graphical user interface and thus easy to use.  \n",
